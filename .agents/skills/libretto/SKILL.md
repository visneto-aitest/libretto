## How Libretto Works

- Libretto is a CLI for exploring live websites and building or debugging reusable browser automation scripts.
- Use Libretto commands to inspect the site and open pages, observe state, inspect requests, and prototype interactions.
- Libretto work must end in script changes. Create or edit the workflow file instead of stopping at interactive exploration.

## Default Integration Approach

- Prefer network requests first for new integrations unless the user explicitly asks for Playwright or UI automation, then do not use the site's internal API.
- Read `references/site-security-review.md` before committing to a network-first approach on a new site.
- Fall back to passive interception or Playwright-driven UI automation when the security review rules network requests out, the request path is not workable, or the user explicitly asks for Playwright.

## Setup

- Ask the user to set up snapshot analysis before relying on `snapshot` for page understanding.
- Use `npx libretto init` for first-time workspace setup.
- If credentials are already available, `npx libretto ai configure openai|anthropic|gemini|vertex` is usually enough.

## Working Rules

- Announce which session you are using and what page you are on.
- Ask instead of guessing when it is unclear what to click, type, or submit.
- Defer repo/code review until you begin generating code, unless the user explicitly asks for it earlier.
- Read and follow guidelines in `references/code-generation-rules.md` before generating or editing production workflow code.
- Validation requires a successful clean `run --headless` with confirmation of the actual returned output, not just process success. If the user wants to watch the finished workflow, do a final headed `run` after headless validation succeeds.
- Treat exploration sessions as disposable unless the user explicitly wants one kept open.
- Get explicit user confirmation before mutating actions or replaying network requests that may have side effects.
- Never run multiple `exec` commands at the same time.

## Commands

### `open`

- Open a page before using `exec` or `snapshot`.
- Use `open` at the start of script authoring when you need live page state to decide how the workflow should work.
- Use headed mode when the user needs to log in or watch the workflow.

```bash
npx libretto open https://example.com --headed
npx libretto open https://example.com --headless --session debug-example
```

### `snapshot`

- Use `snapshot` as the primary page observation tool.
- Always provide both `--objective` and `--context`.
- Use it before guessing at selectors, after workflow failures, and whenever the visible page state is unclear.
- When analysis is involved, expect it to take time. Use a timeout of at least 2 minutes for shell-wrapped calls.

```bash
npx libretto snapshot \
  --objective "Find the sign-in form and submit button" \
  --context "I just opened the login page and need the email field, password field, and submit button."
npx libretto snapshot \
  --session debug-example \
  --page <page-id> \
  --objective "Explain why the table is empty" \
  --context "I opened the referrals page, applied filters, and expected rows to appear."
```

### `exec`

- Use `exec` for focused inspection and short-lived interaction experiments.
- Use `exec` to validate selectors, inspect data, or prototype a step before you encode it in the workflow file.
- Let failures throw. Do not hide `exec` failures with `try/catch` or `.catch()`.
- Do not run multiple `exec` commands in parallel.

```bash
npx libretto exec "return await page.url()"
npx libretto exec "return await page.locator('button').count()"
npx libretto exec --visualize "await page.locator('button:has-text(\"Continue\")').click()"
```

### `pages`

- Use `pages` when a popup, new tab, or second page appears.
- If `exec`, `snapshot`, `network`, or `actions` complains about multiple pages, list page ids first and then pass `--page`.

```bash
npx libretto pages --session debug-example
npx libretto exec --session debug-example --page <page-id> "return await page.url()"
```

### `network`

- Use `network` to inspect the requests the page already made.
- Prefer this when discovering how a site loads data or when validating whether a network-first approach is workable.
- Filter aggressively by method, URL pattern, and page when the log is noisy.

```bash
npx libretto network --session debug-example --last 20
npx libretto network --session debug-example --method POST --filter 'referral|patient'
npx libretto network --session debug-example --page <page-id>
```

### `actions`

- Use `actions` when you need a quick record of recent user or agent interactions in the current session.
- Keep it lightweight. It is a helper for orientation, not the main integration-building workflow.
- Read `references/action-logs.md` when you need to understand what `actions.jsonl` contains, how Libretto chooses selectors for user events, or why a logged action resolved to a generic target.

```bash
npx libretto actions --session debug-example --last 20
npx libretto actions --session debug-example --action click --source user
```

### `run`

- Use `run` to verify a workflow file after creating it or editing it, preferring `run --headless` for the normal fix/verify loop.
- Plain `run` defaults to headed mode.
- If the workflow fails, Libretto keeps the browser open. Inspect the failed state with `snapshot` and `exec` before editing code.
- Insert `await pause(session)` statements in the workflow file when you need to stop at specific states for interactive debugging, like breakpoints in the browser flow.
- If the workflow pauses, resume it with `npx libretto resume --session <name>`.
- Re-run the same workflow after each fix to verify the browser behavior end to end.

```bash
npx libretto run ./integration.ts main --headless --params '{"status":"open"}'
npx libretto run ./integration.ts main --auth-profile app.example.com
```

### `resume`

- Workflows pause by calling `await pause()` in the workflow file.
- Use `resume` when a workflow hit `await pause()`.
- Keep resuming the same session until the workflow completes or pauses again.

```bash
npx libretto resume --session debug-example
```

### `save`

- Use `save` only when the user explicitly asks to save or reuse authenticated browser state.

```bash
npx libretto save app.example.com
```

### `close`

- Use `close` when the user is done with the session or an exploration session is no longer helping progress (unless the user asked to keep watching that browser).
- `close --all` is available for workspace cleanup.

```bash
npx libretto close --session debug-example
npx libretto close --all
```

## References

- Read `references/configuration-file-reference.md` when you need to inspect or change `.libretto/config.json` for snapshot model selection or viewport defaults.
- Read `references/site-security-review.md` before reviewing the site's security posture and deciding whether to lead with network requests, passive interception, or Playwright DOM automation on a new site.
- Read `references/code-generation-rules.md` before writing or editing production workflow files.
- Read `references/auth-profiles.md` when auth-profile behavior is relevant.
- Read `references/pages-and-page-targeting.md` when a session has multiple open pages or you need `--page`.
- Read `references/action-logs.md` when action log structure, selector choice, or user-vs-agent event interpretation matters.
