# Configuration File Reference

Use this reference when you need to inspect or change the workspace configuration that powers `snapshot` analysis and default viewport behavior.

## When to Use This

- You want to confirm which AI model `snapshot` will use.
- You want to understand where Libretto stores workspace-level settings.
- You want a persistent default viewport for `open` or `run`.

## File Location

Libretto reads workspace config from `.libretto/config.json`.

- The file is created by `npx libretto setup` during first-time onboarding (auto-pins the default model for the detected provider) or by `npx libretto ai configure ...` for explicit overrides.
- API credentials still come from your shell environment or `.env`. The config file stores the selected model, not the secret itself.
- Use `npx libretto status` to inspect the current AI configuration and open sessions without changing anything.
- For first-time setup instructions, follow the main `SKILL.md` flow instead of expanding this reference.

## Supported Settings

- `snapshotModel` selects the configured analysis model for `snapshot`.
- `viewport` is an optional top-level setting used by `open` and `run` when you do not pass `--viewport`.
- Viewport precedence is: CLI `--viewport`, then `.libretto/config.json`, then the default `1366x768`.
- `sessionMode` sets the default session access mode for new sessions created by `open`, `connect`, and `run`. Must be `"read-only"` or `"write-access"`. When omitted, defaults to `"write-access"`. Pass `--read-only` or `--write-access` to `open`, `connect`, or `run` to override when creating a session.

Example:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "snapshotModel": "openai/gpt-5.4",
  "viewport": {
    "width": 1280,
    "height": 800
  },
  "sessionMode": "write-access"
}
```

## Common Commands

```bash
npx libretto setup                                         # first-time onboarding, auto-pins default model
npx libretto status                                        # inspect AI config and open sessions
npx libretto ai configure openai                           # explicitly change provider/model
npx libretto open https://example.com --viewport 1440x900
npx libretto run ./integration.ts --viewport 1440x900
```

## Notes

- If you want a persistent default viewport for the workspace, add `viewport` to `.libretto/config.json` instead of repeating `--viewport` on every command.
- If `snapshot` analysis is not configured yet, run `npx libretto setup` to auto-configure, or see the main `SKILL.md` flow.
- Run `npx libretto status` at any time to check which model is active and whether credentials are present.
