# Libretto

Libretto gives your coding agent superpowers for building, debugging, and maintaining browser RPA integrations.

It is designed for engineering teams that automate workflows in web apps and want to move from brittle browser-only scripts to faster, more reliable network-first integrations.

## Installation

```bash
npm install --save-dev libretto
```

Chromium is downloaded automatically via a `postinstall` script. If postinstall scripts are disabled (e.g. `--ignore-scripts`, common in monorepos), run init manually:

```bash
npx libretto init
```

This installs the Chromium browser binary and optionally configures an AI runtime for snapshot analysis.

## Usage

Libretto is usually used through prompts with the Libretto skill.

### One-shot script generation

```text
Use the Libretto skill. Go on LinkedIn and scrape the first 10 posts for content, who posted it, the number of reactions, the first 25 comments, and the first 25 reposts.
```

### Interactive script building

```text
Use the Libretto skill. Let's interactively build a script to scrape scheduling info from the eClinicalWorks EHR.
```

### Convert browser automation to network requests

```text
We have a browser script at ./integration.ts that automates going to Hacker News and getting the first 10 posts. Convert it to direct network scripts instead. Use the Libretto skill.
```

### Fix broken integrations

```text
We have a browser script at ./integration.ts that is supposed to go to Availity and perform an eligibility check for a patient. But I'm getting a broken selector error when I run it. Fix it. Use the Libretto skill.
```

You can also run workflows directly from the CLI:

```bash
npx libretto help
npx libretto run ./integration.ts main
```

## The `.libretto/` directory

Libretto stores local runtime state in a `.libretto/` directory at your project root. Add it to your `.gitignore`:

```
.libretto/
```

This directory contains:

- **`profiles/<domain>.json`** — Saved browser sessions (cookies, localStorage) for authenticated sites. Created by `npx libretto save <domain>`. These are machine-local and should never be committed.
- **`sessions/<name>/state.json`** — Active session metadata (debug port, PID, status). Each CLI session or `launchBrowser()` call creates one.
- **`sessions/<name>/logs.jsonl`** — Session logs including captured network requests and user actions (clicks, fills, navigations). Useful for debugging and for converting browser automations to direct network calls.
- **`ai.json`** — AI runtime configuration (which model/command to use for snapshot analysis).
