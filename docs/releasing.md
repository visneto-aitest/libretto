# Releasing Libretto

Libretto uses a simple release flow:

1. Create a release PR from `main`.
2. Merge the PR into `main`.
3. Let GitHub Actions publish the package and create the GitHub release.

This repo does not publish from local machines and does not push directly to `main`.

## Requirements

GitHub Actions needs these repository secrets:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: used by the existing test suite during the release workflow.

The release workflow uses a GitHub Actions environment named `release`. Configure that environment in the repository settings and require approval from the maintainers who are allowed to publish. Enable `Prevent self-review` if you want a second maintainer to approve every release.

On npm, configure `libretto` to trust this repository and workflow for publishing. The trusted publisher fields should match:

- Organization or user: `saffron-health`
- Repository: `libretto`
- Workflow filename: `release.yml`
- Environment name: `release`

If you prefer the CLI, the setup command is:

```bash
npm trust github libretto --repo saffron-health/libretto --file release.yml --env release
```

Trusted publishing only works on supported cloud-hosted runners. This workflow uses `ubuntu-latest`, which satisfies that requirement. npm also requires a recent toolchain for trusted publishing, so the publish job runs on Node 24.

The workflow needs `contents: write` to create the GitHub release and tag, and `id-token: write` so npm trusted publishing can exchange the GitHub OIDC token for a short-lived publish credential.

After trusted publishing is working, remove any old npm publish token from the repo secrets. npm recommends restricting token-based publishing after the migration.

GitHub release notes are auto-generated from merged pull requests. The release note categories live in `.github/release.yml`, so PR labels control where entries show up in the changelog.

## Prepare a release PR

Run one of these from a clean working tree:

```bash
pnpm release:prepare -- patch
pnpm release:prepare -- minor
pnpm release:prepare -- major
```

The script in `scripts/prepare-release.sh` does the following:

1. Checks that the working tree is clean.
2. Updates local `main` from `origin/main`.
3. Runs `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, `pnpm type-check`, and `pnpm test`.
4. Bumps the version in `package.json`.
5. Creates a branch named `tk-release-vX.Y.Z`.
6. Commits the version bump.
7. Pushes the branch and opens a PR to `main`.

Release PRs also run the eval workflow. That workflow compares the current eval score against the latest successful `main` baseline and fails if the score drifts by more than 5 percentage points in either direction.

## Merge behavior

After the release PR merges, `.github/workflows/release.yml` runs on `main`.

The workflow:

1. Reads the version from `package.json`.
2. Checks whether that version already exists on npm and in GitHub Releases.
3. Runs install, type-check, and tests in a verification job.
4. Waits for approval on the `release` environment before the publish job can access release permissions.
5. Publishes `libretto@X.Y.Z` to npm with trusted publishing if it is not already published.
6. Creates GitHub release `vX.Y.Z` with generated release notes if it does not already exist.

This makes the workflow safe to re-run after partial failures. For example, if npm publish succeeds but GitHub release creation fails, a re-run will skip npm and only create the missing release.

## Eval gating on release PRs

`.github/workflows/evals.yml` now runs automatically for release PRs and for qualifying pushes to `main`.

- On `main`, it records the current eval summary as the baseline artifact for future release PRs.
- On release PRs, it runs evals again and compares the overall score against the latest successful `main` baseline.
- If the score moves outside a `+/-5%` window, the eval job fails and flags the release PR.

If no successful baseline artifact exists yet, the release PR eval job reports that and skips the comparison for that run.

## Changelog behavior

The GitHub Releases page is the changelog for this repo.

When the workflow runs `gh release create ... --generate-notes`, GitHub builds the release notes from the merged PRs since the previous release. `.github/release.yml` groups PRs into sections such as Features, Fixes, and Documentation.

Today the categories map directly to labels that already exist in the repo:

- `enhancement` -> Features
- `bug` -> Fixes
- `documentation` -> Documentation

To keep release notes readable, use clear PR titles and apply one of those labels before merging. If a PR should not appear in the changelog, add the `skip-changelog` label.

## Notes

- Protect `main` in GitHub settings. The release environment protects publishing, but branch protection is still the control that limits who can merge release-triggering commits into `main`.
- Only merge a release PR when `main` is ready to ship.
- Do not create git tags in the PR branch. Tags are created by the release workflow after merge.
- If you need richer release notes later, keep this flow and replace `--generate-notes` with a more explicit changelog step.
